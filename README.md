# Paired-Sample-T-test
It is just a simple Python Application that lets you calculate Paired Sample T-test, I still have a lot to learn and code.

before using, make sure you install necessary modules like
1. numpy
2. scipy

if you do not know how to install modules, check on the web
if you are using jupyter:

if you are using pycharm:

I just forgot to delete the matplotlib but you can delete that if you want.
go crazy, mess with it if you want
